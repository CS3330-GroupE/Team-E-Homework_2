For this program to work, it is necessary to have a proper file path or file structure to run. If the array is not being filled by student objects, but the file exists, try changing file path in main.java to either "homework_2/files/studentData.txt" or "files/studentData.txt" or whatever path necessary. 

When run successfully, the program will read the file, create student objects in an array, and allow the user to search for students by ID number and Display all student objects. Furthermore, the user can update the grades of a student by supplying a valid ID and a new grade.
